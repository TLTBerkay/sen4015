\section*{\centering{Abstract}}
Nowadays, with the effect of globalization on every
business line, the rate of acceleration of the movements
in the markets increases, which is a negative factor for
investors in the business world. In the project we are
trying to create as a solution to this problem is based
on the idea of \textit{arbitrage}.\\\\In order to take advantage of
price differences, we aim to create a graphical interface
by creating an algorithm that can predict the profitability
of money, precious metal, bond and stock trading transactions,
and process these data with Matplotlib.\\\\In this way, it is
one of the main purposes of revealing this project for
entrepreneurs and investors who will enter the investment
ecosystem to carry out activities with less loss and high
profit. Our project has a simple GUI and it is another of
our goals to be simple and understandable, in the first
stage, we aim to make the exchange rates and interest
rates manually enter or keep them in the system as a
fixed value, and one of our aims to set an example in
revealing the idea and purpose of the project is the
course of the project and our.\\\\Depending on our workload,
we aim to connect API's, thus collecting instant currency
and commodity values from digital platforms.
